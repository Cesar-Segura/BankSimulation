# BankSimulation

This program simulates a virtual bank that the user can interact with using a GUI created using Python's Tkinter.

I created this program for an assignment that was assigned for one of my computer science classes in college; it 
fully embraces an object-oriented approach to programming while also integrating some elements of event-driven programming 
to incorporate the interactive GUI. 

The program needs to be run in a virtual environment using Python 3.10 with TKcalender imported in a pipfile. 
The following commands can be typed in the terminal on your local machine to get started. The format is (command), where you do not need to type the parenthesis to enter the command (I add this to separate the command from the regular text in this description). 

First, type the following: (python3.10 -m pip install pipenv) followed by the command: (pipenv install --python 3.10) to install the virtual environment
Next, type the following to activate the virtual environment: (pipenv shell)
    
The program stores all the information associated with the bank, accounts, transactions, etc. in a SQL database file.
It also handles many common formatting errors that the user may make when inputting data for the program to process.
